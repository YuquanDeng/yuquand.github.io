## About Me

I am a Research Engineer at the [Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence (AI2)](https://allenai.org/), where I work on the [PRIOR team](https://prior.allenai.org/). I received my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from the [University of Washington](https://www.washington.edu/).

My research interests broadly lie in robotics and computer vision. I have been fortunate to work with [Yi Li](https://yili.vision/), [Yuxiang Yang](https://yxyang.github.io/), and [Xiangyun Meng](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xymengxy/), under the guidance of [Dieter Fox](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~fox/) and [Byron Boots](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~bboots/).
